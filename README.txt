This project contains four python Flask applications, a secure and insecure version for both stored and reflected XXS attacks.
In order to run them, run the file with "python3 {filename}"
This will run the application on local host, navigate to your localhost address or follow the link in the command line response "running on {address of webpage}" to open it
From there, you can use and test the websites as you wish
